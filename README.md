In Web_scrapping 
most of the files are test files 
web.py--->web5.py,web_test.py are broken up semi-independent functions from Ult_web2.py
Ult_web.py is used to download a single episode from animepahe.com
Ult_web2.py is used to download multiple episodes from animepahe.com
API.py is a file caleb helped me make to make the ui that I modified(original file could be found in the main branch with the same name)
Ult_web2-terminal.py is used to download files from animepahe.com but using the terminal and not a ui
image.py is used to download an amount of pics from a site
fdm.crx is a chrome extension
the rest of the files were mostly used as temporary test files
